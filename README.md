# Productivity Counter
This is the program code that was written for a device that I designed for a subject at my university. The device was based on the ESP-32 microcontroller and was intended to measure effective working time. It was controlled by four buttons. The LCD display showed the measured run time and break time. When the set break time passed, the device emitted a sound signal (buzzer) and began to light up (rgb digital LED modules). Below you can see the schematic and pcb poard project designed in Eagle and a picture of the circuit assembled on a universal board.
